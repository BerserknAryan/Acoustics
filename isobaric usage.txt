isobaric usage
# Usage examples
# Calculate enclosure volume for vented isobaric conditions
vas = 0.5  # Example value for Vas
qts = 0.4  # Example value for Qts
enclosure_volume = ISOBARIC.isobaric(vas, qts)
print("Enclosure Volume:", enclosure_volume)

# Calculate tuning frequency for vented enclosure in isobaric conditions
tuning_frequency = ISOBARIC.VentedIsobaric.calculate_tuning_frequency(vas, qts, enclosure_volume)
print("Tuning Frequency:", tuning_frequency)

# Calculate cut-off frequency for vented enclosure in isobaric conditions
fs = 1000  # Example value for fs
cut_off_frequency = ISOBARIC.VentedIsobaric.calculate_cut_off_frequency(fs, qts)
print("Cut-off Frequency:", cut_off_frequency)

# Calculate optimal port area for vented enclosure in isobaric conditions
port_area = ISOBARIC.VentedIsobaric.calculate_port_area(tuning_frequency, enclosure_volume)
print("Optimal Port Area:", port_area)

# Calculate required port length for vented enclosure in isobaric conditions
port_length = ISOBARIC.VentedIsobaric.calculate_port_length(port_area, tuning_frequency)
print("Required Port Length:", port_length)

# Estimate air speed within the port for vented enclosure in isobaric conditions
air_speed = ISOBARIC.VentedIsobaric.calculate_air_speed(port_area, tuning_frequency, enclosure_volume)
print("Air Speed within the Port:", air_speed)

# Determine the overall efficiency of vented enclosure in isobaric conditions
efficiency = ISOBARIC.VentedIsobaric.calculate_efficiency(enclosure_volume, tuning_frequency, qts, fs)
print("Overall Efficiency:", efficiency)
